## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Voice Provider Management UI**: Configure TTS and STT providers from Settings > Voice
  - Auto-detection of API keys from environment variables and LLM provider configs
  - Toggle switches to enable/disable providers without removing configuration
  - Local binary detection for whisper.cpp, piper, and sherpa-onnx
  - Server availability checks for Coqui TTS and Voxtral Local
  - Setup instructions modal for local provider installation
  - Shared Google Cloud API key between TTS and STT

- **New TTS Providers**:
  - Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (380+ voices, 50+ languages)
  - Piper (fast local neural TTS, runs offline)
  - Coqui TTS (high-quality neural TTS with voice cloning)

- **New STT Providers**:
  - Mistral AI Voxtral (cloud-based, 13 languages)
  - Voxtral Local via vLLM (self-hosted with OpenAI-compatible API)

- **Mobile PWA Support**: Install moltis as a Progressive Web App on iOS, Android, and desktop
  - Standalone mode with full-screen experience
  - Custom app icon (crab mascot)
  - Service worker for offline support and caching
  - Safe area support for notched devices

- **Push Notifications**: Receive alerts when the LLM responds
  - VAPID key generation and storage for Web Push API
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe toggle in Settings > Notifications
  - Subscription management UI showing device name, IP address, and date
  - Remove any subscription from any device
  - Real-time subscription updates via WebSocket
  - Client IP detection from X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, CF-Connecting-IP headers
  - Notifications sent for both streaming and agent (tool-using) chat modes

- **Safari/iOS PWA Detection**: Show "Add to Dock" instructions when push notifications
  require PWA installation (Safari doesn't support push in browser mode)

### Changed

- Push notifications feature is now enabled by default in the CLI

- **TLS HTTP redirect port** now defaults to `gateway_port + 1` instead of
  the hardcoded port `18790`. This makes the Dockerfile simpler (both ports
  are adjacent) and avoids collisions when running multiple instances.
  Override via `[tls] http_redirect_port` in `moltis.toml` or the
  `MOLTIS_TLS__HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` environment variable.

- **TLS certificates use `moltis.localhost` domain.** Auto-generated server
  certs now include `moltis.localhost`, `*.moltis.localhost`, `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` as SANs. Banner and redirect URLs use
  `https://moltis.localhost:<port>` when bound to loopback, so the cert
  matches the displayed URL. Existing certs are automatically regenerated
  on next startup.

- **Certificate validity uses dynamic dates.** Cert `notBefore`/`notAfter`
  are now computed from the current system time instead of being hardcoded.
  CA certs are valid for 10 years, server certs for 1 year from generation.

### Fixed

- Push notifications not sending when chat uses agent mode (run_with_tools)
- Missing space in Safari install instructions ("usingFile" → "using File")
- **WebSocket origin validation** now treats `.localhost` subdomains
  (e.g. `moltis.localhost`) as loopback equivalents per RFC 6761.

### Documentation

- Added voice.md with TTS/STT provider documentation and setup guides
- Added mobile-pwa.md with PWA installation and push notification documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with cargo feature policy (features enabled by default)
